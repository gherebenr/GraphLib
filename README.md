# Graphics Library
Small graphics library that allows a user to draw polygons, curves and display 3D objects with basic lighting.

### Getting Started
1) Open a terminal in the folder where all the files are.
2) Run: ```make``` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  This will compile everything.
3) Run: ```./GLib``` | This will run the program.
4) Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal.

#### Prerequisites
1) FreeGLUT. 
2) I used GCC 7.2.1 to compile on Linux.

#### To get it working in Windows, go to the FreeGLUT website (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) and download Martin Payne's Windows binaries. Then follow the instructions in the Readme.txt file to get it to compile in Visual Studio. Beware that the performance is much worse than on Linux.
