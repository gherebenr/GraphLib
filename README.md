# Graphics Library
Small graphics library that allows a user to draw polygons, curves and display 3D objects with basic lighting.

### Getting Started
1) Open a terminal in the folder where all the files are.
2) Run: ```make``` -  This will compile everything.
3) Run: ```./GLib``` - To run the program.
4) Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal.

#### Prerequisites
You need to install FreeGLUT.

#### NOTE: I only ever compiled and ran this program on Linux, so I don't know if it will work on Windows.
